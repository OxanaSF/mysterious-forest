## Overview

This website contains a three-level game. First two levels are quiz based, last level is a number guessing game. To retrieve data from https://opentdb.com/ I used fetch()method. For first two levels were used different endpoints to get random questions in easy level and to get medium level questions based on the category the used chose.
